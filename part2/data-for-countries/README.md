# Data for Countries

In this exercise, we created an application, in which one can look at data of various countries. The data are fetched from the API https://restcountries.eu, that provides a lot data for different countries in a machine readable format, a so-called REST API.

The user interface is very simple. The country to be shown is found by typing a search query into the search field.

## Start the application
