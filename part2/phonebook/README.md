# Course information

In this exercise we will create a simple phonebook.

The application have the ability to add, update and delete a person's contact details. Person's names are unique, which means that users cannot add names that are already present in the phonebook. The application also have the ability to fiter the contacts.

The data will be stored in `db.json`, which will be used by the tool `json-server` that acts as a backend server.

## Start the application

To start an application, do the following :

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ npm install

# In terminal 1: Start the application
$ npm start

# In terminal 2: Run the json-server
$ npm run server
```

You can see the output of the app at: http://localhost:3000/
