# Solutions of Part 2 exercises

In this part first, we will take a look at how to render a data collection, like a list of names, to the screen. After this, we will inspect how a user can submit data to a React application using HTML forms. Next, our focus shifts towards looking at how JavaScript code in the browser can fetch and handle data stored in a remote backend server. Lastly, we will take a quick look at a few simple ways of adding CSS styles to our React applications.

> In this section, I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is a new generation frontend tool instead of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start the application

Each folder in the `part2` is a separate application.

# Install dependancies
$ yarn install

# Start the application
