# Phonebook API

In this exercise, we have implemented RESTful API using Node.js & Express.js. The frontend of the application written in React.js. The application uses MongoDB as a database to store the data.

The application is deployed on Heroku as [phonebookapp-service](https://phonebookapp-service.herokuapp.com/)
