# Phonebook API

In this project, we developed a comprehensive phonebook application featuring a backend in Node.js and a frontend in React.js. Data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the application is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) at the following URL.

> https://phonebook-microservice.fly.dev/

## Start the application locally

To start the application:

```bash
# Install dependancies
$ yarn install

# create a .env file and put there the MONGODB_URI for connecting to your mongodb database
$ echo "MONGODB_URI=<YOUR-MONGODB-URI>" > .env

# Start the application
$ yarn run dev
```

You can then access the app on : http://localhost:8080/
