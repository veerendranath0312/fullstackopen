# Solutions of Part 1 exercises

In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the React-library, which we will be using to write the code that runs in the browser. We will also look at some features of JavaScript that are important for understanding React.

> In this section, I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which is a new generation frontend tool instead of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Start the application

Each folder in the `part1` is a separate application.

```bash
# Head to the desired exercise (courseinfo, unicafe or anecdotes)
$ cd courseinfo

# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```
